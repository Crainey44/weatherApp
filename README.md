# weatherApp
Built a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS with javascript and jquery.  
Application uses third-party APIs to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL.

*Application can search weather by city name and return temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.

*We tried to add the second API call for the five-day forecast, but couldn't successfully get the data.
